# emacs-config
Due to popular demand, my emacs config will now be publicly available! (by popular demand I mean Jack, but that sounds a lot less cool now doesn't it?)

I'm a recovered vim user, so yes this config does make use of evil among other things, so if you're not into vim keybinds this may not be the best starting point for you. At the top of my init.el I have a wishlist of things I wish were part of my config and am currently working on adding, but if you have any suggestions, don't be afraid to open an issue!
