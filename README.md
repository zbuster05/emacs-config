# emacs-config
Due to popular demand, my emacs config will now be publicly available! (by popular demand I mean Jack, but that sounds a lot less cool now doesn't it?)

I'm a recovered vim user, so yes this config does make use of evil among other things, so if you're not into vim keybinds this may not be the best starting point for you.

## Contribution
Yeah it's kind of janky, but at the top of my init.el I have a wishlist of things I wish were part of my config and am currently w`orking on adding. If you have any suggestions, or how to implement any of the things on the list, don't be afraid to open an issue or PR! I'd love to collaborate.
